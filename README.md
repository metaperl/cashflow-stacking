# cashflow-stacking

The Income Snowball(tm), aka cashflow stacking, is a method to generate monthly cashflow using amortized payments back to yourself.

It is protected by patent 8788409B1 - https://patents.google.com/patent/US8788409B1/

It is based on borrowing money (from a FUNDING-SOURCE) to buy an amortized investment (e.g. a PROFIT-SOURCE) 
and stacking the monthly investment returns to generate monthly passive income.

In the purest income snowball:
- the funding source is a line of credit or a credit card
- the profit source is a somethling like peer to peer lending or stock market investments

In the DIBS (dynamic income banking system), both the funding source and profit source are potentially both a cash value 
life insurance policy. DIBS is described in the book "DIBS on your money" by Michael Kwong.

An exploration and quantification of DIBS occurred in the book "Red Hot Cashflow: the 5-year blueprint to 5 figures per month
and 6 figues of cash value" by me, Terrence Brannon.
